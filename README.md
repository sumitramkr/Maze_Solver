# Maze_Solver
The project can generate random perfect mazes of given dimensions, store them as matrices, and show them pictorially. It can solve for typical endpoints - start being the top left cell and stop being the bottom right cell - or solve for any selected endpoints in the maze which the user feeds during runtime by clicking within the maze. It can also allow the user to solve it by navigating through the maze with arrow keys. The algorithm used to generate the random maze is Recursive Backtracker also known as  Randomised Depth First Search and the one to solve it is Depth First Search (DFS).
